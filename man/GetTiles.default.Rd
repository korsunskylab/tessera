\description{
Segmentation has four main steps:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Preparing data structures:} A triangle mesh is constructed using Delauney
triangulation and pruned to eliminate long edges. PC embeddings for each
each are computed.
\item \strong{Computing gradients:} Gradients are calculated at each point by considering
the difference in expression between each cell in its neighbors in the mesh.
These gradients are smoothed using (anisotropic) bilateral filtering, and then
gradients are defined for edges and triangles in the mesh by averaging the
points that each edge or triangle contains.
\item \strong{DMT:} A scalar field is defined by taking the magnitude of the total gradient
at each point/edge/triangle. Then DMT-based segmentation is performed by constructing
a maximum spanning forest on the triangles and a minimum spanning forest on the points.
Separatrices that separate cells into tiles of homogeneous composition are defined
by tracing paths between critical points, particularly between saddle edges and maximum
triangles.
\item \strong{Aggregation:} Tiles from DMT-based segmentation are merged using single-linkage
agglomerative clustering to obtain tiles containing a number of cells between a
user-provided minimum and maximum value. Pairs of adjacent tiles are scored according
to their transcriptional similarity, compactness of shape after merging, and number
of cells in order to prioritize favorable merges in each agglomerative clustering step.

\details{
\subsection{Computing gradients (smoothing)}{

Gradient fields are smoothed using bilateral filtering,
in which the smoothed gradient of each point is computed as
the weighted average of the neighbors' gradients, considering
both distance in space and also similarity in gradients.
The weight of each neighbor is computed from the product of two scores:
\itemize{
\item \code{distance} score: Generally, closer neighbors have greater weight.
\itemize{
\item if \code{'euclidean'}: Gaussian transformation of the Euclidean distance
of a cell from its neighbor, so that more distant neighbors have less weight.
\item if \code{'projected'}: An anisotropic filter that accounts for expected
change in expression along the direction of the neighbor. The expected
change in expression is calculated from the gradient field as the total
derivative in the direction of the neighbor. This change in expression is
then Gaussian transformed so that neighbors that are more distant along the
direction of greatest change have less weight.
\item if \code{'constant'}: All neighbors have equal \code{distance} weights
}
\item \code{similarity} score: Generally, neighbors with more similar gradients have
greater weight
\itemize{
\item if \code{'euclidean'}: Gaussian transformation of the Euclidean distance
between a cell's gradient field and its neighbor's gradient field.
\item if \code{'projected'}: Gaussian transformation of the cosine distance
between a cell's gradient field and its neighbor's gradient field.
\item if \code{'constant'}: All neighbors have equal \code{similarity} weights
}
}
}

\subsection{Aggregation (scores)}{

Pairs of adjacent tiles are scored according to their transcriptional similarity,
compactness of shape after merging, and number of cells in order to prioritize
favorable merges in each agglomerative clustering step. The \code{dscore} for each edge
is computed as the product of the following three factors, where higher scores
favor merging of adjacent tiles:
\itemize{
\item \code{w}: A 2-cluster GMM is used to determine the mean \code{mu} and standard deviation \code{sig} of the distance
between tiles that have similar gene expression (Euclidean distance \code{d} in PC space).
Then we define \code{d_mu = mu + sig} and \code{d_sig = alpha * sig}, and calculate \code{w} as
\code{w = 0.5 - 1 / (1 + exp(-(d - d_mu) / d_sig))}. Ranges from -0.5 to 0.5. If adjacent tiles
are very dissimilar (\verb{d >> d_mu}), then \code{d} is large, and \code{w} is close to \code{-0.5}. If adjacent
tiles are very similar (\code{d < d_mu}), then \code{d} is small, and \code{w} is positive.
\item \code{score_size}: \code{(1 - npts_from/max_npts) * (1 - npts_to/max_npts)}. Ranges from 0 to 1.
In the first round of aggregation, if merging the two tiles would have a total number
of points ≥\code{max_npts}, then \code{score_size} is set to \code{-Inf}, which prevents merging.
In the second round of aggregation, \code{dscore} is set to \code{-Inf} if both adjacent tiles
have at least \code{min_npts} cells, to prioritize merging of small tiles.
\item \code{dC}: \code{.5 * (C_merge - C_from - C_to + 1)}. Ranges from 0 to 1.
