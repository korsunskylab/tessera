#' Run full DMT segmentation pipeline to make aggregated tiles from cells
#' 
#' Segmentation has four main steps:
#'   1. **Preparing data structures:** A triangle mesh is constructed using Delauney
#'      triangulation and pruned to eliminate long edges. PC embeddings for each
#'      each are computed.
#'   2. **Computing gradients:** Gradients are calculated at each point by considering
#'      the difference in expression between each cell in its neighbors in the mesh.
#'      These gradients are smoothed using (anisotropic) bilateral filtering, and then
#'      gradients are defined for edges and triangles in the mesh by averaging the
#'      points that each edge or triangle contains.
#'   3. **DMT:** A scalar field is defined by taking the magnitude of the total gradient
#'      at each point/edge/triangle. Then DMT-based segmentation is performed by constructing
#'      a maximum spanning forest on the triangles and a minimum spanning forest on the points.
#'      Separatrices that separate cells into tiles of homogeneous composition are defined
#'      by tracing paths between critical points, particularly between saddle edges and maximum
#'      triangles.
#'   4. **Aggregation:** Tiles from DMT-based segmentation are merged using single-linkage
#'      agglomerative clustering to obtain tiles containing a number of cells between a
#'      user-provided minimum and maximum value. Pairs of adjacent tiles are scored according
#'      to their transcriptional similarity, compactness of shape after merging, and number
#'      of cells in order to prioritize favorable merges in each agglomerative clustering step.
#' 
#' ## Computing gradients (smoothing)
#' 
#' Gradient fields are smoothed using bilateral filtering,
#' in which the smoothed gradient of each point is computed as
#' the weighted average of the neighbors' gradients, considering
#' both distance in space and also similarity in gradients.
#' The weight of each neighbor is computed from the product of two scores:
#' * `distance` score: Generally, closer neighbors have greater weight.
#'   * if `'euclidean'`: Gaussian transformation of the Euclidean distance
#'     of a cell from its neighbor, so that more distant neighbors have less weight.
#'   * if `'projected'`: An anisotropic filter that accounts for expected
#'     change in expression along the direction of the neighbor. The expected
#'     change in expression is calculated from the gradient field as the total
#'     derivative in the direction of the neighbor. This change in expression is
#'     then Gaussian transformed so that neighbors that are more distant along the
#'     direction of greatest change have less weight.
#'   * if `'constant'`: All neighbors have equal `distance` weights
#' * `similarity` score: Generally, neighbors with more similar gradients have
#'   greater weight
#'   * if `'euclidean'`: Gaussian transformation of the Euclidean distance
#'     between a cell's gradient field and its neighbor's gradient field.
#'   * if `'projected'`: Gaussian transformation of the cosine distance
#'     between a cell's gradient field and its neighbor's gradient field.
#'   * if `'constant'`: All neighbors have equal `similarity` weights
#' 
#' ## Aggregation (scores)
#' 
#' Pairs of adjacent tiles are scored according to their transcriptional similarity,
#' compactness of shape after merging, and number of cells in order to prioritize
#' favorable merges in each agglomerative clustering step. The `dscore` for each edge
#' is computed as the product of the following three factors, where higher scores
#' favor merging of adjacent tiles:
#'   * `w`: A 2-cluster GMM is used to determine the mean `mu` and standard deviation `sig` of the distance
#'     between tiles that have similar gene expression (Euclidean distance `d` in PC space).
#'     Then we define `d_mu = mu + sig` and `d_sig = alpha * sig`, and calculate `w` as
#'     `w = 0.5 - 1 / (1 + exp(-(d - d_mu) / d_sig))`. Ranges from -0.5 to 0.5. If adjacent tiles
#'     are very dissimilar (`d >> d_mu`), then `d` is large, and `w` is close to `-0.5`. If adjacent
#'     tiles are very similar (`d < d_mu`), then `d` is small, and `w` is positive. 
#'   * `score_size`: `(1 - npts_from/max_npts) * (1 - npts_to/max_npts)`. Ranges from 0 to 1.
#'     In the first round of aggregation, if merging the two tiles would have a total number
#'     of points ≥`max_npts`, then `score_size` is set to `-Inf`, which prevents merging.
#'     In the second round of aggregation, `dscore` is set to `-Inf` if both adjacent tiles
#'     have at least `min_npts` cells, to prioritize merging of small tiles.
#'   * `dC`: `.5 * (C_merge - C_from - C_to + 1)`. Ranges from 0 to 1.
